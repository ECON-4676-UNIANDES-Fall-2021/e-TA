       "'  Albert Camus   Los justos                Biblioteca Virtual  OMEGALFA   Albert Camus Los justos  2    Los justos (título original en francésuna obra teatral escrita por el escritor francés Albert Camus. Está dividida en cinco actos y fue representada en el Théatre Hébertot en París, el 15 de diciembre de 1949. La obra de Albert Camus ubica al lector en el contexto de la revolución rusa de 1905, y la incomformidad de un grupo de revolucionarios que quieren atacar la tira-nía del zar. Basado en una historia real se da una discu-sión entre dos hombres de la revolución que ejemplifi-carían los dos puntos de vista que Camus quiere expli-car: Stepan que corresponde a la facción \"fuerte\" Y Ka-liayev que representa la facción soñadora de la revolu-ción. La obra girará entonces en torno a estas ideas.   PERSONAJES DORA DULEBOV LA GRAN DUQUESA  IVAN KALIAYEV  STEPAN FEDOROV  BORIS ANNENKOV  ALEXIS VOINOV  SKURATOV FOKA EL CARCELERO        ------ Albert Camus Los justos  3   ACTO PRIMERO  En el piso de los terroristas. Por la mañana.   Se levanta el telón en silencio. DORA y ANNEN-KOV en escena, inmóviles. Se oye una vez el tim-bre de la entrada. ANNENKOV hace un gesto pa-ra detener a DORA que parece querer decir algo. El timbre suena dos veces seguidas.    ANNENKOV: Es él. (Sale. DORA aguarda, sin moverse. ANNENKOV vuelve con STE-PAN, a quien agarra por los hombros.) ANNENKOV: ¡Es él! Aquí está Stepan. DORA (se acerca a STEPAN y le da la mano): ¡Qué alegría, Ste-pan!  STEPAN: Hola, Dora. DORA (le mira): Tres años ya. STEPAN: Sí, tres años. El día que me detuvieron, iba a reunirme con vosotros. DORA: Te esperábamos. Pasaba el tiempo y cada vez se me encogía más el corazón. No nos atrevíamos ni a mirarnos. ANNENKOV: Tuvimos que cambiar de piso otra vez.  STEPAN: Lo sé. Albert Camus Los justos  4 DORA: ¿Y allá, Stepan? STEPAN: ¿Allá?  DORA: ¿En la cárcel?  STEPAN: La gente se evade. ANNENKOV: Sí. Nos alegramos al enterarnos de que habías podido llegar a Suiza. STEPAN: Suiza es otra cárcel, Boria. ANNENKOV: ¿Qué dices? Allá son libres, al menos. STEPAN: La libertad es una cárcel mientras haya un solo hom-bre esclavizado en la tierra. Yo era libre y no dejaba de pensar en Rusia y sus esclavos. (Silencio.) ANNENKOV: Me alegro mucho, Stepan, de que el partido te haya mandado aquí.  STEPAN: Era necesario. Me ahogaba. Actuar, actuar por fin... (Mira a ANNENKOV.) Lo mataremos, ¿verdad?  ANNENKOV: Estoy seguro. STEPAN: Mataremos a ese verdugo. Tú eres el jefe, Boria, y te obedeceré.  ANNENKOV: No necesito tu promesa, Stepan. Somos todos hermanos. STEPAN: Hace falta disciplina. Lo he comprendido en la cárcel. El partido socialista revolucionario necesita disciplina. Discipli-nados mataremos al gran duque y destruiremos la tiranía. DORA (acercándose a él): Siéntate, Stepan, debes de estar can-sado después de ese largo viaje. STEPAN: Yo nunca me canso. (Silencio. DORA se sienta.)  STEPAN: ¿Está todo listo, Boria? ANNENKOV(cambiando de tono): Desde hace un mes, dos de los nuestros estudian los movimientos del gran duque. Dora ha Albert Camus Los justos  5 reunido el material necesario.  STEPAN: ¿Está redactada la proclama? ANNENKOV: Sí. Toda Rusia sabrá que el gran duque Sergio fue ejecutado con una bomba por el grupo de combate del partido socialista revolucionario para acelerar la liberación del pueblo ruso. La corte imperial sabrá también que estamos decididos a ejercer el terror hasta que la tierra sea restituida al pueblo. ¡Sí, Stepan, todo está preparado! Se acerca el momento. STEPAN: ¿Qué debo hacer yo? ANNENKOV: Para empezar, ayudarás a Dora. Schweitzer, a quien tú reemplazas, trabajaba con ella. STEPAN: ¿Murió?  ANNENKOV: Sí.  STEPAN: ¿Cómo?  DORA: Un accidente. (STEPAN mira a DORA. DORA desvía la mirada.) STEPAN: ¿Y después? ANNENKOV: Después, ya veremos. Debes estar dispuesto a sustituirnos, llegado el caso, y a mantener el enlace con el Co-mité Central. STEPAN: ¿Quiénes son nuestros camaradas? ANNENKOV: Conociste a Voinov en Suiza. Confío en él, a pe-sar de su juventud. No conoces a Yanek. STEPAN: ¿Yanek? ANNENKOV: Kaliayev. Le llamarnos también el Poeta.  STEPAN: No es un nombre para un terrorista. ANNENKOV (riendo): Yanek piensa lo contrario. Dice que la poesía es revolucionaria.  STEPAN: Sólo la bomba es revolucionaria. (Silencio.) Dora, ¿crees que sabré ayudarte?  Albert Camus Los justos  6 DORA: Sí. Lo único que hay que cuidar es de que no se rompa el tubo. STEPAN: ¿Y si se rompe? DORA: Así murió Schweitzer. (Una pausa.) ¿Por qué sonríes, Stepan?  STEPAN: ¿Sonrío? DORA: Sí. STEPAN: Me sucede a veces. (Una pausa. STEPAN parece refle-xionar.) Dora, ¿bastaría una sola bomba para hacer saltar esta casa? DORA: Una sola no. Pero haría estragos. STEPAN: ¿Cuántas se necesitarían para hacer saltar Moscú?  ANNENKOV: ¡Estás loco! ¿Qué quieres decir? STEPAN: Nada. (Llaman una vez. Todos escuchan y aguardan. Llaman dos veces. ANNENKOV pasa a la antesala y vuelve con VOINOV.) VOINOV: ¡Stepan STEPAN: Hola. (Se estrechan la mano. VOINOV se acerca a DORA y la besa.) ANNENKOV: ¿Ha ido todo bien, Alexis?  VOINOV: Sí. ANNENKOV: ¿Estudiaste el recorrido desde el palacio hasta el teatro? VOINOV: Ahora puedo dibujarlo. Mira (dibuja.) Recodos, calles estrechas, obstáculos....., el coche pasará bajo nuestras venta-nas. ANNENKOV: ¿Qué significan esas dos cruces? VOINOV: Una placita donde los caballos habrán de moderar el paso, y el teatro donde se detendrán. En mi opinión, son los mejores lugares. Albert Camus Los justos  7 ANNENKOV: ¡Dame!  STEPAN: ¿Y los confidentes?  VOINOV (vacilante): Hay muchos.  STEPAN: ¿Te impresionan?  VOINOV: No me siento tranquilo. ANNENKOV: Nadie se siente tranquilo con ellos delante. No te preocupes.  VOINOV: No temo nada. Lo que pasa es que no me acostum-bro a mentir.  STEPAN: Todo el mundo miente. Lo que hace falta es mentir bien. VOINOV: No es fácil. Cuando yo era estudiante, mis compañe-ros se burlaban de mí porque no sabía disimular. Decía lo que pensaba. Al final me echaron de la Universidad. STEPAN: ¿Por qué? VOINOV: En el curso de historia, el profesor me preguntó có-mo Pedro el Grande había edificado Petrogrado. STEPAN: Buena pregunta. VOINOV: Con sangre y a latigazos, contesté. Me echaron.  STEPAN: Y después... VOINOV: Comprendí que no bastaba denunciar la injusticia. Era menester dar la vida para combatirla. Ahora soy feliz. STEPAN: ¿Y sin embargo, mientes? VOINOV: Miento. Pero no mentiré el día que arroje la bomba. (Llaman. Dos timbrazos, después uno sólo. DORA se precipita.)  ANNENKOV: Es Yanek. STEPAN: No es la misma señal. ANNENKOV: A Yanek le divirtió cambiarla. Tiene su señal pro-pia. Albert Camus Los justos  8 (STEPAN se encoge de hombros. Se oye hablar a DORA en la antesala. Entran DORA y KALIAYEV, del brazo. KALIAYEV ríe.) DORA: Yanek. Este es Stepan, que reemplaza a Schweitzer. KALIAYEV: Bienvenido, hermano. STEPAN: Gracias. (DORA y KALIAYEV se sientan frente a los demás.) ANNENKOV: Yanek, ¿estás seguro de que reconocerás la cale-sa? KALIAYEV: Sí, la vi dos veces muy detenidamente. ¡En cuanto aparezca la reconoceré entre mil! He anotado todos los detalles. Por ejemplo, uno de los cristales de la linterna izquierda está desportillado. VOINOV: ¿Y los soplones? KALIAYEV: A montones. Pero somos viejos amigos. Me com-pran cigarrillos. (Se ríe.) ANNENKOV: ¿Pavel ha confirmado el informe? KALIAYEV: El gran duque irá esta semana al teatro. Dentro de un rato, Pavel sabrá el día exacto y entregará un mensaje al portero. (Se vuelve hacia DORA y ríe.) Tenemos suerte, Dora. DORA (mirándole): ¿Ya no eres buhonero? Ahora estás hecho un gran señor. Qué guapo estás. ¿No echas de menos la zama-rra? KALIAYEV (ríe): Es cierto, estaba muy orgulloso de ella. (A STEPAN y a ANNENKOV.) Me pasé dos meses observando a los buhoneros y más de un mes ensayando en mi cuarto. Mis cole-gas nunca tuvieron sospechas. «Un gran tipo», decían. «Sería capaz de vender hasta los caballos del zar.» Y a su vez trataban de imitarme. DORA: Naturalmente, eso te divertía. KALIAYEV: Ya sabes que no puedo impedirlo. El disfraz, la nueva vida... Todo me divertía.  Albert Camus Los justos  9 DORA: A mí no me gustan los disfraces. (Muestra su vestido.) ¡Y además, esta antigualla lujosa! Ya podía Boria haberme encon-trado otra cosa. ¡Una actriz! ¡Con lo sencilla que soy yo! KALIAYEV (ríe): Estás tan hermosa con ese vestido. DORA: ¡Hermosa! Me gustaría estarlo. Pero no hay que pensar en esas cosas.  KALIAYEV: ¿Por qué? ¿Por qué siempre esa mirada tan triste, Dora? Hay que ser alegre, hay que ser orgullosa. ¡La belleza existe, la alegría existe! «En los lugares tranquilos donde te an-helaba mi corazón... DORA (sonriente): Yo respiraba un eterno verano...» KALIAYEV: Oh, Dora, te acuerdas de esos versos. ¿Sonríes? Eso me alegra mucho.  STEPAN (cortándolo): Estamos perdiendo el tiempo. Boria, su-pongo que hay que avisar al portero, ¿no? (KALIAYEV le mira con asombro.) ANNENKOV: Sí. Dora, ¿quieres bajar? No olvides la propina. Voinov te ayudará después a juntar el material en el cuarto. (Salen cada uno por su lado. STEPAN va hacia ANNENKOV con paso decidido.) STEPAN: Yo quiero arrojar la bomba. ANNENKOV: No, Stepan. Ya están designados los que van a arrojarla.  STEPAN: Te lo ruego. Tú sabes lo que eso significa para mí. ANNENKOV: No. La regla es la regla. (Un silencio.) Yo no la arrojo y voy a esperar aquí. La regla es dura. STEPAN: ¿Quién lanzará la primera bomba?  KALIAYEV: Yo. Voinov arroja la segunda.  STEPAN: ¿Tú? KALIAYEV: ¿Te entraña? ¡Así que no tienes confianza en mí! Albert Camus Los justos  10 STEPAN: Se necesita experiencia. KALIAYEV: ¿Experiencia? Sabes muy bien que sólo se hace una vez y después... Nadie la arrojó nunca dos veces. STEPAN: Se necesita una mano firme. KALIAYEV (mostrando su mano): Mira. ¿Crees que temblará? (STEPAN se aparta.) KALIAYEV: No temblará. ¡Vamos! Con el tirano frente a mí ¿voy a vacilar? ¿Cómo puedes creerlo? Y aunque me tiemble el brazo, conozco un medio seguro de matar al gran duque. ANNENKOV: ¿Cuál? KALIAYEV: Arrojarse bajo las patas de los caballos. (STEPAN se encoge de hombros y va a sentarse al fondo.) ANNENKOV: No, no será necesario. Habrá que intentar la hui-da. La organización te necesita, debes cuidarte. KALIAYEV: ¡Obedeceré, Boria! ¡Qué honor, qué honor para mí! Oh, seré digno de él. ANNENKOV: Stepan, tú estarás en la calle mientras Yanek y Alexis esperen la llegada de la calesa. Pasarás cada cierto tiem-po delante de nuestras ventanas y contendremos una señal. Dora y yo esperaremos aquí el momento de lanzar la proclama. Con un poco de suerte, el gran duque caerá. KALIAYEV (con exaltación): ¡Sí, lo mataré! ¡Qué felicidad si tenemos éxito! Pero el gran duque no es nada. ¡Hay que gol-pear más arriba! ANNENKOV: Primero el gran duque. KALIAYEV: ¿Y si fracasamos, Boria? ¿Ves? Habría que imitar a los japoneses.  ANNENKOV: ¿Qué quieres decir? KALIAYEV: Durante la guerra, los japoneses no se rendían. Se suicidaban.  Albert Camus Los justos  11 ANNENKOV: No. No pienses en el suicidio. KALIAYEV: ¿En qué, entonces?  ANNENKOV: En el terror, de nuevo. STEPAN (hablando desde el fondo): Para suicidarse hay que quererse mucho. Un verdadero revolucionario no puede que-rerse a sí mismo. KALIAYEV (volviéndose vivamente): ¿Un verdadero revoluciona-rio? ¿Por qué me tratas así? ¿Qué te he hecho yo? STEPAN: No me gustan los que entran en la revolución porque se aburren.  ANNENKOV: ¡Stepan! STEPAN (levantándose y acercándose a ellos): Sí, soy brutal. Pero para mí el odio no es un juego. No estamos aquí para admirarnos unos a otros. Estamos aquí para triunfar.  KALIAYEV (suavemente): ¿Por qué me ofendes? ¿Quién te ha dicho que yo me aburra? STEPAN: No sé. Cambias las señales, te gusta hacer el papel de buhonero, dices versos, quieres arrojarte bajo las patas de los caballos, y ahora, el suicidio (Le mira.) No tengo confianza en ti. KALIAYEV (dominándose): No me conoces, hermano. Amo la vida. No me aburro. Entré en la revolución porque me gusta la vida. STEPAN: Yo no amo la vida, sino la justicia, que está por enci-ma de la vida. KALIAYEV (Con visible esfuerzo): Cada uno sirve a la justicia como puede. Hay que aceptar que seamos diferentes. Tenemos que querernos, sí podemos. STEPAN: No podemos. KALIAYEV (estallando): Entonces, ¿qué estás haciendo con nosotros? Albert Camus Los justos  12 STEPAN: He venido para matar a un hombre, no para quererlo ni para reconocer su diferencia. KALIAYEV (violentamente): No lo matarás solo, ni en nombre de nada. Lo matarás con nosotros y en nombre del pueblo ru-so. Esa es tu justificación. STEPAN (Con el mismo tono): No la necesito. Quedé justificado en una noche, y para siempre, hace tres años, en la cárcel. Y no soportaré... ANNENKOV: ¡Basta! ¿Estáis locos? ¿Recordáis a quién nos de-bemos? ¡Somos hermanos, confundidos unos con otros, dis-puestos a ejecutar a los tiranos para libertar al país! Matamos juntos, y nada puede separarnos. (Silencio. Les mira.) Ven, Ste-pan, debemos convenir señales... (STEPAN sale.) ANNENKOV (a KALIAYEV) : No es nada. Stepan ha sufrido. Hablaré con él.  KALIAYEV (Muy pálido) Me ha ofendido, Boria.: (Entra DORA.) DORA (al ver a KALIAYEV): ¿Qué pasa?  ANNENKOV: Nada. (Sale.) DORA (a KALIAYEV) : ¿Qué pasa?  KALIAYEV: Hemos chocado. No me quiere. (DORA se sienta en silencio. Pausa.) DORA: Creo que no quiere a nadie. Cuando todo haya termi-nado será más feliz. No estés triste. KALIAYEV: Estoy triste. Necesito que todos vosotros me que-ráis. Lo he abandonado todo por la organización. ¿Cómo sopor-tar que mis hermanos se aparten de mí? A veces tengo la im-presión de que no me comprenden. ¿Es culpa mía? Soy torpe, lo sé... DORA: Te quieren y te comprenden. Stepan es diferente. Albert Camus Los justos  13 KALIAYEV: No. Sé lo que piensa. Ya Schweitzer lo decía: «De-masiado extraordinario para ser revolucionario.» Yo quería ex-plicarles que no soy extraordinario. Me encuentran un poco loco, demasiado espontáneo. Sin embargo, creo como ellos en la causa. Como ellos, quiero sacrificarme. Yo también puedo ser hábil, taciturno, disimulado, eficaz. Sólo que la vida sigue pareciéndome maravillosa. Amo la belleza y la felicidad. Por eso es por lo que odio el despotismo. ¿Cómo explicarles esto? ¡La revolución, claro! Pero la revolución por la vida, para dar una posibilidad a la vida, ¿comprendes? DORA (Con ímpetu): Sí... (Más bajo, después de un silencio.) Y sin embargo, vamos a matar. KALIAYEV: ¿Quiénes? ¿Nosotros?... Ah, quieres decir... No es lo mismo. Oh, no, no es lo mismo. ¡Y además, matamos para construir un mundo en el que nadie mate nunca más! Acepta-mos ser criminales para que la tierra se cubra por fin de inocen-tes. DORA: ¿Y si no ocurriera eso? KALIAYEV: Calla, bien sabes que es imposible. Entonces Stepan tendría razón. Y habría que escupirle a la belleza a la cara. DORA: Soy más antigua que tú en la organización. Sé que nada es sencillo. Pero tú tienes fe... Todos necesitarnos fe. KALIAYEV: ¿Fe? No. Uno solo la tenía. DORA: Tú tienes fuerza de ánimo. Y te abrirás paso hasta llegar al fin. ¿Por qué has querido arrojar la primera bomba? KALIAYEV: ¿Puede hablarse de la acción terrorista sin participar en ella?  DORA: No. KALIAYEV: Hay que estar en la primera fila. DORA (que parece reflexionar): Sí. Hay la primera fila y hay el último momento. Debemos pensar en ello. Ahí está el coraje, la exaltación que necesitamos..., que tú necesitas. KALIAYEV: Desde hace un año, no pienso en otra cosa. Por Albert Camus Los justos  14 este momento he vivido hasta ahora. Y ahora sé que quisiera morir allí mismo, al lado del gran duque. Perder mi sangre has-ta la última gota, o arder de una sola vez, en la llama de la ex-plosión, y no dejar nada tras de mí. ¿Comprendes por qué he pedido arrojar la bomba? Morir por la causa es la única manera de estar a su altura. Es la justificación. DORA: Yo también deseo esa muerte. KALIAYEV: Sí, es una felicidad envidiable. Por la noche, a ve-ces me agito en mi jergón de buhonero. Un pensamiento me atormenta: nos han convertido en asesinos. Pero pienso al mismo tiempo que voy a morir, y entonces mi corazón se apa-cigua. Sonrío, ¿sabes?, y me duermo como un niño. DORA: Está bien así, Yanek. Matar y morir. Pero en mi opinión, hay una felicidad todavía mayor. (Pausa. KALIAYEV la mira. Ella baja los ojos.) El cadalso. KALIAYEV (febrilmente): Lo he pensado. Morir en el momento del atentado deja algo inconcluso. Entre el atentado y el cadal-so, en cambio, hay toda una eternidad, la única posible quizá para el hombre. DORA (con voz apremiante, cogiéndole las manos) Ese pensa-miento debe ayudarte. Pagamos más de lo que debemos. KALIAYEV: ¿Qué quieres decir? DORA: Nos vemos obligados a matar, ¿verdad? ¿Sacrificamos deliberadamente una vida, una sola? KALIAYEV: Sí. DORA: Pero ir hacia el atentado y luego hacia el cadalso, es dar dos veces la vida. Pagamos más de lo que debemos. KALIAYEV: Sí, es morir dos veces. Gracias, Dora. Nadie puede reprocharnos nada. Ahora estoy seguro de mí. (Silencio.) ¿Qué te pasa, Dora? ¿No dices nada? DORA Quisiera ayudarte un poco más. Sólo que...  KALIAYEV: ¿Sólo qué? Albert Camus Los justos  15 DORA: No, estoy loca.  KALIAYEV: ¿Desconfías de mí? DORA: Oh, no, querido, desconfío de mí. Desde la muerte de Schweitzer a veces se me ocurren ideas raras. Y además, no me corresponde a mí decirte qué es lo que será difícil. KALIAYEV: Me gusta lo difícil. Si me estimas, habla. DORA (mirándole): Lo sé. Eres valiente. Eso es lo que me in-quieta. Te ríes, te exaltas, te encaminas al sacrificio lleno de fervor. Pero dentro de algunas horas habrá que salir de este sueño y actuar. Quizá sea mejor hablar antes... para evitar una sorpresa, un desfallecimiento... KALIAYEV: No tendré desfallecimientos. Dime lo que piensas. DORA: Bueno, pues el atentado, el cadalso, morir dos veces, es lo más fácil. Te bastará el ánimo. Pero la primera fila... (Se ca-lla, le mira y parece vacilar.) En la primera fila vas a verlo... KALIAYEV: ¿A quién?  DORA: Al gran duque.  KALIAYEV: Un segundo apenas. DORA: ¡Un segundo en que vas a verlo! ¡Oh, Yanek, tienes que saberlo, tienes que estar prevenido! Un hombre es un hombre. El gran duque quizá tenga ojos bondadosos. Lo verás rascarse la oreja o sonreír alegremente. Quién sabe, tal vez tenga un pequeño tajo hecho con la navaja de afeitar. Y si te mira en ese momento... KALIAYEV: No es a él a quien voy a matar. Mato al despotismo. DORA: Claro, claro. Hay que matar al despotismo. Yo prepararé la bomba y al sellar el tubo, ¿sabes?, en el momento más difícil, cuando los nervios están tensos, sentiré, sin embargo, una en-traña felicidad en el corazón. Pero no conozco al gran duque y mi tarea sería menos fácil si mientras lo hago estuviera sentado delante de mí. Tú vas a verlo de cerca. Muy de cerca... KALIAYEV (Con violencia) No lo veré.  Albert Camus Los justos  16 DORA: ¿Por qué? ¿Vas a cerrar los ojos? KALIAYEV: No. Pero, Dios mediante, el odio me llegará en el momento oportuno, y me cegará. (Llaman. Una vez. Permanecen inmóviles. Entran STEPAN Y VOINOV.) (Voces en la antesala. Entra ANNENKOV.) ANNENKOV: Es el portero. El gran duque irá al teatro mañana. (Les mira.) Todo debe de estar listo, Dora. DORA (con voz sorda): Sí. (Sale lentamente.) KALIAYEV (la mira salir y en voz baja, volviéndose hacia STE-PAN): Lo mataré. ¡Con alegría!   TELÓN                Albert Camus Los justos  17  ACTO SEGUNDO  Al día siguiente, por la noche. En el mismo lugar.   (ANNENKOV mira por la ventana. DORA está junto a la mesa.)   ANNENKOV: Están en sus puestos. Stepan ha encendido su cigarrillo.  DORA: ¿A qué hora debe pasar el gran duque? ANNENKOV: De un momento a otro. Escucha. ¿No es una cale-sa? No. DORA: Siéntate. Ten paciencia.  ANNENKOV: ¿Y las bombas? DORA: Siéntate. No podemos hacer nada más.  ANNENKOV: Sí. Envidiarles. DORA: Tu puesto está aquí. Eres el jefe. ANNENKOV: Soy el jefe. Pero Yanek vale más que yo, y es él quien tal vez...  DORA: El riesgo es el mismo para todos. Para el que arroja y para el que no arroja.  ANNENKOV: El riesgo es al fin el mismo. Pero por el momento Yanek y Alexis están en la línea de fuego. Sé que no debo estar con ellos. Sin embargo, a veces tengo miedo de aceptar con demasiada facilidad mi papel. Es cómodo, después de todo, verse obligado a no arrojar la bomba. DORA: ¿Y aunque así fuera? Lo esencial es que hagas lo que debes, y hasta el fin.  Albert Camus Los justos  18 ANNENKOV: ¡Qué tranquila estás! DORA: No estoy tranquila: tengo miedo. Hace tres años que estoy con vosotros, dos años que fabrico bombas. He ejecutado todo y creo que no he olvidado nada. ANNENKOV: Por supuesto, Dora. DORA: Bueno, pues hace tres años que tengo miedo, ese mie-do que apenas la abandona a una en el sueño y que se recupe-ra fresco por la mañana. De modo que he tenido que acostum-brarme. He aprendido a estar tranquila en el momento en que tengo más miedo. No hay de qué enorgullecerse. ANNENKOV: Al contrario, enorgullécete. Yo no he dominado nada. Sabes que echo de menos los tiempos de antes, la vida brillante, las mujeres... Sí, me gustaban las mujeres, el vino, aquellas noches interminables. DORA: Me lo sospechaba, Boria. Por eso te quiero tanto. Tu corazón no ha muerto. Y es preferible que desee todavía el placer a ese horrible silencio que se instala a veces en el mismo lugar del grito. ANNENKOV: ¿Qué estás diciendo? ¿Tú? No es posible.  DORA: Escucho... (DORA se yergue bruscamente. Ruido de carruaje, luego silen-cio.) DORA: No. No es él. Me late el corazón. Ya ves, todavía no he aprendido nada.  ANNENKOV (se dirige a la ventana): Atención. Stepan hace una señal. Es él. (Se oye, en efecto, el lejano rodar de un ca-rruaje que se acerca cada vez más, pasa bajo las ventanas y comienza a alejarse. Largo silencio.) ANNENKOV Dentro de unos segundos... (Escuchan.) ANNENKOV: Qué largo se hace. (DORA hace un ademán. Largo silencio. Se oyen campanas a lo lejos.) Albert Camus Los justos  19 ANNENKOV: No es posible. Yanek ya hubiera arrojado la bom-ba. El coche debe de haber llegado al teatro. ¿Y Alexis? ¡Mira! Stepan vuelve sobre sus pasos y corre hacia el teatro. DORA (abalanzándose hacia él): Han detenido a Yanek. Lo han detenido, con seguridad. Hay que hacer algo. ANNENKOV: Espera. (Escucha.) No. Se acabó. DORA: ¿Cómo ha sucedido)? ¡Yanek detenido sin haber hecho nada! Estaba dispuesto a todo, lo sé. Quería la prisión y el pro-ceso. ¡Pero después de haber matado al gran duque! No así, no, no así! ANNENKOV (mirando hacia afuera): ¡Voinov! ¡Rápido! (DORA va a abrir. Entra VOINOV, con semblante descompues-to.) ANNENKOV: Alexis, pronto; habla. VOINOV: No sé nada. Yo esperaba la primera bomba. Vi que el coche daba la vuelta y no pasaba nada. Perdí la cabeza. Creí que en el último momento habías cambiado nuestros planes, vacilé. Y entonces corrí hasta aquí...  ANNENKOV: ¿Y Yanek? VOINOV: No lo he visto.  DORA: Lo han detenido. ANNENKOV (que sigue mirando hacia afuera): ¡Ahí está! (El mismo juego escénico. Entra KALIAYEV con el rostro bañado en lágrimas.) KALIAYEV (delirante): Hermanos, perdonadme. No pude.  DORA (se le acerca y le coge la mano): No es nada.  ANNENKOV: ¿Qué ha pasado? DORA (a KALIAYEV): No es nada. A veces, en el último mo-mento todo se derrumba.  ANNENKOV: Pero no es posible. Albert Camus Los justos  20 DORA: Déjalo. No eres el único, Yanek. Schweitzer tampoco pudo la primera vez.  ANNENKOV: Yanek, ¿te ha dado miedo? KALIAYEV (sobresaltándose): Miedo, no. ¡No tienes derecho a...! (Llaman con la señal convenida. A una señal de ANNENKOV, VOINOV sale. KALIAYEV está postrado. Silencio. Entra STEPAN.) ANNENKOV: ¿Y? STEPAN: Iban niños en el carruaje del gran duque.  ANNENKOV: ¿Niños? STEPAN: Sí. El sobrino y la sobrina del gran duque.  ANNENKOV: El gran duque iría solo, según Orlov. STEPAN: Estaba también la gran duquesa. Era demasiada gente, supongo, para nuestro poeta. Por fortuna, los soplones no vie-ron nada. (ANNENKOV habla a STEPAN en voz baja. Todos miran a KA-LIAYEV, que alza los ojos hacia STEPAN.) KALIAYEV (enajenado): Yo no podía prever... Niños, niños sobre todo. ¿Has mirado a los niños? Esa mirada grave que tie-nen a veces... Nunca he podido sostener esa mirada... Un se-gundo antes, sin embargo, en la oscuridad, en el rincón de la placita, yo me sentía feliz. Cuando las linternas de la calesa comenzaron a brillar a lo lejos, mi corazón empezó a palpitar de alegría, te lo juro. Latía cada vez más fuerte a medida que aumentaba el ruido. Hacía el mismo ruido en mí. Me daban ganas de saltar. Creo que estaba riéndome. Y decía: «Sí, sí... » ¿Comprendes? (Aparta la mirada de STEPAN y recobra su actitud abatida.) Corrí hacia el coche. En ese momento los vi. Ellos no reían. Estaban muy erguidos y miraban al vacío. ¡Qué aire tan triste tenían! Perdidos en sus trajes de gala, con las manos sobre los muslos, el busto rígido a cada lado de la portezuela. No vi a la gran duquesa, sólo a ellos. Si me hubie-ran mirado, creo que habría arrojado la bomba. Para apagar por Albert Camus Los justos  21 lo menos esa mirada triste. Pero seguían mirando hacia adelan-te. (Alza los ojos hacia los otros. Silencio. Más bajo, todavía.) Entonces no sé qué pasó. Mi brazo se debilitó. Me temblaban las piernas. Un segundo después era ya demasiado tarde. (Si-lencio. Mira al suelo.) Dora, ¿he soñado? Me pareció que las campanas sonaban en ese momento. DORA: No, Yanek, no soñaste. (Apoya la mano en el brazo de KALIAYEV. Este alza la cabeza y los ve a todos mirándole. Se levanta.) KALIAYEV: Miradme, hermanos; mírame, Boria, no soy un co-barde, no me he echado atrás. No los esperaba. Todo ocurrió demasiado rápidamente. Aquellas dos caritas serias y en mi mano ese peso terrible. Había que arrojarlo sobre ellos. Así. Directo. ¡Oh, no! No pude. (Desplaza su mirada de uno a otro.) KALIAYEV: En otro tiempo, cuando conducía el coche, en mi casa, en Ucrania, iba como el viento, no temía nada. Nada en el mundo, salvo atropellar a un niño. Me imaginaba el choque, la cabeza frágil golpeando el suelo... (calla.) Ayudadme (Silen-cio.) Quería matarme. He vuelto porque pensé que debía ren-diros cuentas, que vosotros sois mis únicos jueces, que me di-réis si tenía razón o no, que no podíais equivocaros. Pero no decís nada. (DORA se le acerca hasta tocarlo. Él les mira; con voz abatida.) Propongo esto: Si decidís que hay que matar a esos niños, esperaré a la salida del teatro y arrojaré solo la bomba a la calesa. Sé que no fallaré. No tenéis más que decir, yo obedeceré a la organización. STEPAN: La organización te había ordenado que mataras al gran duque.  KALIAYEV: Es verdad. Pero no me había pedido que asesinara niños.  ANNENKOV: Yanek tiene razón. Eso no estaba previsto. STEPAN: Debía obedecer. ANNENKOV: Yo soy el responsable. Tenía que estar todo pre-Albert Camus Los justos  22 visto para que nadie pudiera dudar acerca de su tarea. Lo único que debemos decidir es si dejamos escapar definitivamente esta ocasión o si ordenamos a Yanek que espere a la salida del tea-tro.  Alexis, ¿qué dices? VOINOV: No sé. Creo que yo hubiera hecho lo mismo que Yanek. Pero no estoy seguro de mí. (Más bajo.) Me tiemblan las manos. ANNENKOV: ¿Dora? DORA (con violencia): Yo hubiera retrocedido, como Yanek. ¿Puedo aconsejar a los demás lo que yo misma no podría ha-cer? STEPAN: ¿Os dais cuenta de lo que significa esta decisión? Dos meses de vigilancia, de terribles peligros corridos y evitados, dos meses perdidos para siempre. Igor detenido por nada. Ri-kov colgado por nada. ¿Y habrá que empezar de nuevo? ¿Otra vez largas semanas de vigilancia y astucia, de tensión incesante, antes de encontrar otra ocasión propicia? ¿Estáis locos? ANNENKOV: Dentro de dos días, el gran duque volverá al tea-tro, lo sabes. STEPAN: Dos días en que corremos el riesgo de que nos pes-quen, tú mismo lo dijiste.  KALIAYEV: Voy. DORA: ¡Espera! (A STEPAN.) ¿Tú podrías, Stepan, con los ojos abiertos, tirar a quemarropa sobre un niño? STEPAN: Podría, si la organización lo ordenara.  DORA: ¿Por qué cierras los ojos? STEPAN: ¿Yo? ¿He cerrado los ojos?  DORA: Sí. STEPAN: Entonces fue para imaginarme mejor la escena y con-testar con conocimiento de causa. DORA: Abre los ojos y comprende que la organización perdería su poder y su influencia si tolerara, por un solo momento, que Albert Camus Los justos  23 nuestras bombas aniquilaran niños. STEPAN: No tengo bastante corazón para esas tonterías. El día en que nos decidamos a olvidar a los niños, seremos los amos del mundo y la revolución triunfará. DORA: Ese día la humanidad entera odiará a la revolución. STEPAN: Qué importa, si la amamos lo bastante para imponerla a la humanidad entera y para salvarla de sí misma y de su es-clavitud. DORA: ¿Y si la humanidad entera rechaza la revolución? ¿Y si el pueblo entero, por el que luchas, se niega a que maten a sus hijos? ¿Habrá que castigarlo también?  STEPAN: Si es necesario, sí, hasta que comprenda. Yo también amo al pueblo.  DORA: El amor al pueblo no tiene ese rostro. STEPAN: ¿Quién lo dice?  DORA: Yo, Dora. STEPAN: Eres una mujer y tienes una idea desdichada del amor. DORA (con violencia): Pero tengo una idea justa de lo que es la vergüenza. STEPAN: Yo también tuve vergüenza, una sola vez, y por culpa de los demás. Cuando me azotaron. Porque me azotaron. ¿Sa-béis lo que es el látigo? Vera estaba a mi lado y se suicidó en señal de protesta. Yo he seguido viviendo. ¿De qué había de tener vergüenza, ahora? ANNENKOV: Stepan, aquí todo el mundo te quiere y te respeta. Pero cualquiera que sean tus razones, yo no puedo dejarte de-cir que todo está permitido. Cientos de nuestros hermanos han muerto para que se sepa que no todo está permitido. STEPAN: Nada de lo que pueda servir a nuestra causa está prohibido. ANNENKOV (con ira): ¿Está permitido entrar en la policía y hacer doble juego, como lo proponía Evno? ¿Tú lo harías? Albert Camus Los justos  24 STEPAN: Sí, si fuera necesario. ANNENKOV (levantándose): Stepan, olvidaremos lo que acabas de decir en consideración a lo que has hecho por nosotros y con nosotros. Pero recuerda esto: se trata de saber si dentro de un instante hemos de lanzar bombas contra esos dos niños STEPAN: ¡Niños! Es la única palabra que tenéis en la boca. Pero ¿es que no comprendéis nada? Porque Yanek no mató a esos dos, miles de niños rusos seguirán muriendo de hambre duran-te años. ¿Habéis visto morir de hambre a los niños? Yo sí. Y la muerte por una bomba es un placer comparada con ésa. Pero Yanek no los ha visto. Sólo vio a los dos perros sabios del gran duque. ¿No sois hombres? ¿Vivís sólo en el momento presente? Entonces elegid la caridad y curad tan sólo el mal de cada día, no elijáis la revolución que quiere curar todos los males, los presentes y los por venir. DORA: Yanek está conforme en matar al gran duque, ya que su muerte puede anticipar el día en que los niños rusos no se mueran de hambre. Eso no es fácil. Pero la muerte de los so-brinos del gran duque no impedirá que ningún niño se muera de hambre. Hasta en la destrucción hay un orden, hay límites. STEPAN (Violentamente): No hay límites. La verdad es que vo-sotros no creéis en la revolución. (Todos se levantan, menos YANEK) Vosotros no creéis. Si creyerais totalmente, completa-mente, en ella, sí estuvierais seguros de que con nuestros sacri-ficios y nuestras victorias llegaremos a construir una Rusia libe-rada del despotismo, una tierra de libertad que acabará por cubrir el mundo entero, si no dudarais de que entonces el hombre, liberado de sus amos y de sus prejuicios alzará al cielo la cara de los verdaderos dioses, ¿qué pesaría la muerte de dos niños? Admitiríais que os asisten todos los derechos, todos, ¿me oís? Y si esta muerte os detiene es porque no tenéis seguridad de estar en vuestro derecho. No creéis en la revolución. (Silen-cio. KALIAYEV se levanta.) KALIAYEV: Stepan, me avergüenzo de mí y sin embargo no dejaré que sigas. Acepté matar para abatir el despotismo. Pero detrás de lo que dices veo anunciarse un despotismo que, si Albert Camus Los justos  25 alguna vez se instala, hará de mí un asesino cuando trato de ser un justiciero. STEPAN: Qué importa que no seas un justiciero si se hace justi-cia aun por medio de asesinos. Tú y yo no somos nada. KALIAYEV: Somos algo y bien lo sabes, ya que aún hoy hablas en nombre de tu orgullo.  STEPAN: Mi orgullo es cosa mía. Pero el orgullo de los hom-bres su rebeldía, la injusticia en que viven, es cosa de todos nosotros. KALIAYEV: Los hombres no viven sólo de justicia. STEPAN: Cuando les roban el pan, ¿de qué podrían vivir, sino de justicia?  KALIAYEV: De justicia y de inocencia. STEPAN: ¿Inocencia? Tal vez la conozco. Pero decidí ignorarla y hacérsela ignorar a millares de hombres para que un día ad-quiera un sentido más grande. KALIAYEV: Hay que estar muy seguro de que llegará ese día para negar todo lo que hace que un hombre consienta en vivir. STEPAN: Yo estoy seguro. KALIAYEV: No puedes estarlo. Para saber quién de los dos, tú o yo, tiene razón, se necesitará quizá el sacrificio de tres gene-raciones, varias guerras, revoluciones terribles. Cuando esta lluvia de sangre se haya secado sobre la tierra, tú y yo llevare-mos ya mucho tiempo confundidos con el polvo. STEPAN: Otros vendrán entonces, y los saludo como a herma-nos. KALIAYEV (gritando): Otros... ¡Sí! Pero yo amo a los que viven hoy en la misma tierra que yo, y es a ellos a quienes saludo. Por ellos lucho y consiento en morir. Y por una ciudad lejana, de la que no estoy seguro, no iré a golpear el rostro de mis hermanos. No iré a aumentar la injusticia viviente por una justi-cia muerta. (Más bajo pero con firmeza.) Hermanos, quiero hablaros francamente y deciros por lo menos esto que podría Albert Camus Los justos  26 decir el más simple de nuestros campesinos: matar niños es contrario al honor. Y si alguna vez, en vida mía, la revolución llegara a separarse del honor, yo me apartaría de ella. Si lo de-cidís, iré dentro de un instante a la salida del teatro. pero me arrojaré bajo los caballos. STEPAN: El honor es un lujo reservado a los que tienen carrua-jes. KALIAYEV: No. Es la última riqueza del pobre. Tú lo sabes, y también sabes que hay un honor en la revolución. Por él acep-tamos morir. Ese es el honor que te alzó un día bajo el látigo, Stepan, y el que te hace hablar aún hoy. STEPAN (gritando): Cállate. Te prohíbo que hables de eso. KALIAYEV (arrebatado): ¿Por qué había de callarme? Te dejé decir que yo no creía en la revolución. Eso equivalía a decirme que soy capaz de matar al gran duque por nada, que soy un asesino. Te lo dejé decir y no te pegué. ANNENKOV: ¡Yanek! STEPAN: No matar bastante, a veces, es matar por nada. ANNENKOV: Stepan, aquí nadie comparte tu opinión. La deci-sión está tomada.  STEPAN: Entonces me inclino. Pero repetiré que el terror no es para los delicados. Somos homicidas y hemos elegido serlo. KALIAYEV (fuera de sí): No. Yo elegí morir para que el crimen no triunfe. Elegí ser inocente. ANNENKOV: ¡Yanek, Stepan, basta! La organización ha decidi-do que el asesinato de esos niños es inútil. Hay que proseguir la vigilancia. Debemos estar dispuestos a empezar de nuevo dentro de dos días. STEPAN: ¿Y si los niños siguen con él?  KALIAYEV: Esperaremos una nueva ocasión. STEPAN: ¿Y si la gran duquesa acompaña al gran duque?  KALIAYEV: No la perdonaré. Albert Camus Los justos  27 ANNENKOV: Escuchad. (Ruido de un coche. KALIAYEV se dirige irresistiblemente hacia la ventana. Los otros esperan. El coche se acerca, pasa bajo las ventanas y desaparece.) VOINOV (mirando a DORA, que se dirige hacia él): Hay que volver a empezar, Dora...  STEPAN (con desprecio): Sí, Alexis, volver a empezar... ¡Pero hay que hacer algo por el honor!    TELÓN                 Albert Camus Los justos  28  ACTO TERCERO  En el mismo lugar, a la misma hora, dos días después.    STEPAN: ¿Qué hace Voinov? Ya debería estar aquí. ANNENKOV: Necesita dormir. Y todavía tenemos una media hora por delante.  STEPAN: Puedo ir en busca de noticias. ANNENKOV: No. Hay que limitar los riesgos. (Silencio.) Yanek, ¿por qué no dices nada?  KALIAYEV: No tengo nada que decir. No te preocupes. (Lla-man.) Ahí está. (Entra VOINOV.)  ANNENKOV: ¿Has dormido?  VOINOV: Sí, un poco.  ANNENKOV: ¿Toda la noche?  VOINOV: No. ANNENKOV: Era necesario. Hay medios.  VOINOV: Lo intenté. Tenía demasiado cansancio.  ANNENKOV: Te tiemblan las manos. VOINOV: No. (Todos le miran.) ¿Por qué me miráis? ¿Uno no puede estar cansado? ANNENKOV: Se puede estar cansado. Pensamos en ti. VOINOV (Con súbita violencia): Había que haberlo pensado anteayer. Si hubiéramos arrojado la bomba hace dos días, no estaríamos cansados ahora. Albert Camus Los justos  29 KALIAYEV: Perdóname, Alexis. He complicado las cosas.  VOINOV(en voz más baja): ¿Quién dice eso? ¿Por qué más difí-ciles? Estoy cansado, nada más. DORA: Ahora todo irá rápidamente. Dentro de una hora habrá acabado todo. VOINOV: Sí, habrá acabado. Dentro de una hora... (Mira a su alrededor. DORA se le acerca y te coge la mano. El abandona su mano, luego la retira con violencia.) Boria, quisiera hablar con-tigo. ANNENKOV: ¿A solas?  VOINOV: A solas. (Se miran. KALIAYEV, DORA y STEPAN salen.) ANNENKOV: ¿Qué pasa? (VOINOV calla.) Dímelo, por favor... VOINOV: Me da vergüenza, Boria. (Silencio.) Me da vergüenza. Debo decirte la verdad.  ANNENKOV: ¿No quieres arrojar la bomba? VOINOV: No podré arrojarla. ANNENKOV: ¿Tienes miedo? ¿No es más que eso? Eso no es para avergonzarse.  VOINOV: Tengo miedo y me da vergüenza temer miedo. ANNENKOV: Pero anteayer estabas alegre y animoso. Cuando saliste te brillaban los ojos. VOINOV: Siempre he tenido miedo. Anteayer había juntado todo mi valor, nada más. Cuando oí rodar el carruaje a lo lejos, me dije: «¡Vamos! Es cosa de un minuto.» Apretaba los dientes. Tenía todos los músculos tensos. Iba a arrojar la bomba con tanta violencia como si tuviera que matar al gran duque con el choque. Esperaba la primera explosión para hacer estallar toda la fuerza acumulada en mí. Y entonces, nada. El carruaje llegó hasta mí. ¡Qué rápido corría! Me dejó atrás. Comprendí que Yanek no había arrojado la bomba. En ese momento me traspa-só un frío terrible. Y de golpe me sentí débil como un niño. Albert Camus Los justos  30 ANNENKOV: No era nada, Alexis. La vida refluye en seguida. VOINOV: Hace dos días que la vida no vuelve. He mentido hace un rato, no dormí anoche. Me latía con demasiada fuerza el corazón. ¡Ay!, Boria, estoy desesperado. ANNENKOV: No debes estarlo. Todos nos hemos sentido como tú. No arrojarás la bomba. Un mes de descanso en Finlandia y volverás con nosotros. VOINOV: No. Es otra cosa. Si no lanzo la bomba ahora, no la arrojaré nunca.  ANNENKOV: ¿Cómo?  VOINOV: No estoy hecho para el terrorismo. Ahora lo sé. Más vale que os deje. Militaré en los comités, en la propaganda. ANNENKOV: Los riesgos son los mismos. VOINOV: Sí, pero se puede actuar cerrando los ojos. No se sabe nada.  ANNENKOV: ¿Qué quieres decir? VOINOV (febrilmente): No se sabe nada. Es fácil asistir a reuniones, discutir la situación y transmitir después la orden a ejecutar. Se arriesga la vida, claro, pero a ciegas, sin ver nada. En cambio, estar en pie cuando cae la noche sobre la ciudad, en medio de la multitud de los que aprietan el paso para en-contrar la sopa caliente, los hijos, el calor de una mujer, estar en pie y mudo, con el peso de la bomba en la mano, y saber que dentro de tres minutos, dentro de dos minutos, dentro de unos segundos te precipitarás al encuentro de un carruaje res-plandeciente, eso es el terror. Y ahora sé que no podré empe-zar de nuevo sin sentirme vacío de sangre. Sí, me da vergüen-za. He apuntado demasiado alto. Tengo que trabajar en mi puesto. Un puesto muy pequeño. El único del que soy digno. ANNENKOV: No hay puesto pequeño. La prisión y la horca están siempre al final.  VOINOV: Pero no se ven como se ve al que vamos a matar. Hay que imaginarlas. Por suerte, yo no tengo imaginación. (Se Albert Camus Los justos  31 ríe nerviosamente.) Nunca llegué a creer realmente en la policía secreta. Es raro en un terrorista, ¿eh? Al primer puntapié en el vientre creeré. Antes, no. ANNENKOV: ¿Y una vez en la cárcel? En la cárcel se sabe y se ve. Ya no hay olvido.  VOINOV: En la cárcel no hay decisión que tomar. ¡Sí, es eso, no tomar más decisiones! No tener que decirse: «Vamos, te toca a ti; tú, tú tienes que decidir el segundo en que vas a abalanzar-te.» Ahora estoy seguro de que si me detienen, no intentaré evadirme. Para evadirse todavía se necesita inventiva, hay que tomar la iniciativa. Si no te evades, son los demás los que se quedan con la iniciativa. Ellos cargan con todo el trabajo. ANNENKOV: Trabajan para colgarte, a veces. VOINOV (Con desesperación): A veces. Pero me será menos difícil morir que llevar mi vida y la de otro en la mano y decidir el momento en que precipitaré esas dos vidas en las llamas. No, Boria, la única manera que tengo de redimirme es aceptar lo que soy. (ANNENKOV calla.) Hasta los cobardes pueden servir a la revolución. Basta con encontrarles su puesto. ANNENKOV: Entonces todos somos cobardes. Pero no siempre tenemos ocasión de comprobarlo. Haz lo que quieras. VOINOV: Prefiero marcharme en seguida. Me parece que no podría mirarles a la cara. Pero tú se lo dirás.  ANNENKOV: Yo se lo diré. (Se le acerca.) VOINOV: Dile a Yanek que él no tiene la culpa. Y que le quie-ro como os quiero a todos.  (Silencio. ANNENKOV le besa.) ANNENKOV: Adiós, hermano. Todo terminará. Rusia será feliz. VOINOV (huyendo): Oh, sí. ¡Que sea feliz! ¡Que sea feliz! (AN-NENKOV se dirige a la puerta.) ANNENKOV: Venid. (Entran todos con DORA.)  STEPAN: ¿Qué pasa? Albert Camus Los justos  32 ANNENKOV: VOINOV no arrojará la bomba. Está agotado. No sería seguro. KALIAYEV: Tengo yo la culpa, ¿verdad, Boria?  ANNENKOV: Me ha dicho que te quiere.  KALIAYEV: ¿Volveremos a verle?  ANNENKOV: Tal vez. Por ahora nos deja.  STEPAN: ¿Por qué? ANNENKOV: Será más útil en los Comités.  STEPAN: ¿Lo ha pedido él? ¿Así que tiene miedo?  ANNENKOV: No. Lo he decidido yo. STEPAN: ¿A una hora del atentado, nos privas de un hombre? ANNENKOV: A una hora del atentado he tenido que decidir solo. Es demasiado tarde para discutir. Ocuparé yo el lugar de VOINOV. STEPAN: Me corresponde a mí por derecho. KALIAYEV (a ANNENKOV): Tú eres el jefe. Tu deber es quedar-te aquí ANNENKOV: Un jefe tiene a veces el deber de ser cobarde. Pero a condición de que se ponga a prueba su firmeza, llegado el caso. Estoy decidido. Stepan, tú me reemplazarás el tiempo que haga falta. Ven, tienes que conocer las instrucciones. (Salen. KALIAYEV se sienta. DORA se le acerca y le tiende una mano. Pero cambia de opinión.) DORA: Tú no tienes la culpa. KALIAYEV: Le hice daño, mucho daño. ¿Sabes qué me dijo el otro día?  DORA: Repetía sin cesar que era feliz. KALIAYEV: Sí, pero me dijo que no había felicidad para él fuera de nuestra comunidad. «Estamos nosotros, decía, la organiza-ción. Y después no hay nada. Es una orden de caballería.» ¡Qué  33 lástima, Dora! DORA: Volverá. KALIAYEV: No. Me imagino lo que yo sentiría en su lugar. Yo estaría desesperado.  DORA: Y ahora, ¿no lo estás? KALIAYEV (Con tristeza): ¿Ahora? Estoy con vosotros y soy feliz como lo era él.  DORA (lentamente): Es una gran felicidad. KALIAYEV: Es una felicidad muy grande. ¿No piensas como yo? DORA: Pienso como tú. Entonces, ¿por qué estás triste? Hace dos días tu rostro estaba resplandeciente. Parecía que ibas a una gran fiesta. Hoy... KALIAYEV (levantándose, con gran agitación): Hoy sé lo que no sabía. Tenías razón, no es tan sencillo. Yo creía que era fácil matar, que bastaba la idea, y el valor. Pero no soy tan grande y ahora sé que no hay felicidad en el odio. Tanto mal, tanto mal, en mí y en los demás. El crimen, la cobardía, la injusticia... Oh, tengo, tengo que matarlo... ¡Pero llegaré hasta el fin! ¡Más lejos que el odio! DORA: ¿Más lejos que el odio? No hay nada.  KALIAYEV: Está el amor. DORA: ¿El amor? No, no es eso lo que hace falta. KALIAYEV: Oh, Dora, cómo puedes decir eso, a mí, que co-nozco tu corazón... DORA: Hay demasiada sangre, demasiada violencia. Los que aman de verdad a la justicia no tienen derecho al amor. Están erguidos como lo estoy yo, con la cabeza alta, con los ojos fi-jos. ¿Qué pinta el amor en esos corazones orgullosos? El amor curva dulcemente las cabezas, Yanek. Nosotros tenemos la nu-ca rígida. KALIAYEV: Pero nosotros amamos a nuestro pueblo.  34 DORA: Lo amamos, es cierto. Lo queremos con un vasto amor sin apoyo, con un amor desdichado. Vivimos lejos de él, ence-rrados en nuestras habitaciones, perdidos en nuestros pensa-mientos. Y el pueblo ¿nos quiere? ¿Sabe que le queremos? El pueblo calla. ¡Qué silencio, qué silencio...! KALIAYEV: Pero eso es el amor; darlo todo, sacrificarlo todo sin esperanza de reciprocidad. DORA: Tal vez. El amor absoluto, la alegría pura y solitaria es lo que me quema, sí. En ciertos momentos, sin embargo, me pregunto si el amor no es otra cosa, si puede dejar de ser un monólogo, y si no hay respuesta a veces. Me lo imagino, ¿sa-bes?: el sol brilla, las cabezas se curvan dulcemente, el corazón abandona su orgullo, los brazos se abren. ¡Ay!, Yanek, si una pudiera olvidar, aunque sólo fuera por una hora, la miseria atroz de este mundo y dejarse llevar. Una sola hora de egoís-mo, ¿te lo imaginas? KALIAYEV: Sí, DORA, eso se llama ternura. DORA: Lo adivinas todo, querido, eso se llama ternura. Pero ¿la conoces de verdad? ¿Amas a la justicia con ternura? (KALIAYEV calla.) ¿Amas a nuestro pueblo con ese abandono y esa dulzura o, por el contrario, con la llama de la venganza y de la rebel-día? (KALIAYEV sigue callado.) Ya lo ves. (Se le acerca; en tono muy débil.) Y a mí, ¿me amas con ternura? (KALIAYEV la mira.) KALIAYEV (después de un silencio): Nadie te querrá nunca co-mo yo te quiero.  DORA: Lo sé. Pero ¿no es preferible querer como todo el mun-do? KALIAYEV: No soy cualquiera. Te quiero como soy. DORA: ¿Me quieres más que a la justicia, más que a la organi-zación?  KALIAYEV: No te separo de la organización y la justicia. DORA: Sí, pero contéstame; te lo ruego, contéstame. ¿Me quie-res en la soledad, con ternura, con egoísmo? ¿Me querrías si fuera injusta?  35 KALIAYEV: Si fueras injusta y pudiese quererte, no te querría a ti. DORA: No contestas. Dime esto solamente; ¿me querrías si yo no estuviera en la organización? KALIAYEV: ¿Dónde estarías, entonces? DORA: Recuerdo el tiempo en que estudiaba. Reía. Era hermo-sa entonces. Me pasaba las horas paseando y soñando. ¿Me querrías ligera y despreocupada? KALIAYEV (vacila; en voz muy baja): Me muero de ganas de decirte que sí.  DORA (lanzando un grito): Entonces di que sí, querido, si lo piensas y si es cierto. Sí, frente a la justicia, delante de la mise-ria y del pueblo encadenado. Sí, sí, te lo ruego, a pesar de la agonía de los niños, a pesar de los ahorcados y de los azotados hasta la muerte... KALIAYEV: Calla, DORA. DORA: No, que una vez por lo menos hable el corazón. Espero que me llames, a mí, a DORA, que me llames por encima de este mundo envenenado de injusticia...  KALIAYEV (brutalmente): Calla. Mi corazón sólo me habla de ti. Pero, dentro de un instante, no deberé temblar. DORA (enajenada): ¿Dentro de un instante? Sí, me olvidaba... (Se ríe como sí llorara.) No, está muy bien, querido. No te enojes, no he sido razonable. Es el cansancio. Yo tampoco hu-biera podido decirlo. Te quiero con el mismo amor un poco fijo, en la justicia y las prisiones. El verano, Yanek, ¿recuerdas? Pero no, es el eterno invierno. No somos de este mundo, so-mos justos. Hay un calor que no es para nosotros. (Apartándo-se.) ¡Ay, piedad para los justos! KALIAYEV (mirándola con desesperación): Sí, ésa es nuestra parte, el amor es imposible. Pero mataré al gran duque, y habrá entonces una paz tanto para ti como para mí. DORA: ¡La paz! ¿Cuándo la encontraremos?   36 KALIAYEV (Con violencia): Al día siguiente. (Entran ANNENKOV Y STEPAN. DORA y KALIAYEV Se alejan uno del otro.) ANNENKOV: ¡Yanek! KALIAYEV: En seguida. (Respira profundamente.) Por fin, por fin...  STEPAN (acercándosele): Adiós, hermano, estoy contigo.  KALIAYEV: Adiós, Stepan. (Se vuelve hacía DORA.) Adiós, DO-RA.  (DORA se le acerca. Están muy cerca uno del otro, pero no se tocan.) DORA: No, adiós, no. Hasta la vista. Hasta la vista, querido. Nos encontraremos. (El la mira. Silencio.) KALIAYEV: Hasta la vista. Yo... Rusia será hermosa.  DORA (con lágrimas) : Rusia será hermosa.  (KALIAYEV se persigna delante del icono.) (Sale con ANNENKOV. STEPAN se dirige a la ventana. DORA no se mueve; sigue mirando a la puerta.) STEPAN: Qué erguido camina. Me equivoqué, ¿sabes?, al no confiar en Yanek. No me gustaba su entusiasmo. Se persignó, ¿lo viste? ¿Es creyente? DORA: No practica. STEPAN: Sin embargo, tiene un alma religiosa. Eso es lo que nos separaba. Yo soy más áspero que él, bien lo sé. Para los que no creemos en Dios, o tenemos toda la justicia o la deses-peración. DORA: Para él, la justicia misma es desesperante. STEPAN: Sí, un alma débil. Pero la mano es fuerte. El vale más que su alma. Lo matará, es seguro. Eso está bien, está muy  37 bien. Destruir: eso es lo que hace falta. Pero ¿no dices nada? (La observa.) ¿Le quieres? DORA: Hace falta tiempo para querer. Apenas tenemos tiempo bastante para la justicia.  STEPAN: Tienes razón. Hay demasiado que hacer; es necesario destruir este mundo de arriba abajo... Después... (En la venta-na.) Ya no los veo, han llegado. DORA: Después...  STEPAN: Nos amaremos.  DORA: Si seguimos con vida. STEPAN: Otros se amarán. Da lo mismo.  DORA: Stepan, di: «el odio». STEPAN: ¿Cómo? DORA: Esas dos palabras, «el odio», pronúncialas.  STEPAN: El odio. DORA: Está bien. Yanek las pronunciaba muy mal. STEPAN (después de un silencio y caminando hacia ella): Comprendo: me desprecias. Pero ¿estás segura de que tienes razón? (Un silencio; con violencia creciente.) Estáis todos ahí regateando lo que hacéis en nombre del innoble amor. ¡Pero yo no amo a nadie y odio, sí, odio a mis semejantes! ¿Qué me im-porta a mí su amor? Lo conocí en la cárcel, hace tres años. Y hace tres años que lo llevo encima. ¿Quieres que me enternezca y que arrastre la bomba como una cruz? ¡No! No! He ido dema-siado lejos, sé demasiadas cosas...  Mira...  (Se desgarra la camisa. DORA hace un movimiento hacia él. Retrocede ante las marcas del látigo.) ¡Son las marcas! ¡Las mar-cas de su amor! ¿Me desprecias ahora? (Ella se le acerca y le besa bruscamente.) DORA: ¿Quién podría despreciar al dolor? Te quiero también. STEPAN (la mira sordamente): Perdóname, Dora. (Una pausa.  38 Se aparta.) Tal vez sea la fatiga. Años de lucha, la angustia, los chivatos, el presidio... y para terminar esto. (Muestra las mar-cas.) ¿Dónde iba a encontrar yo fuerzas para amar? Por lo me-nos me quedan para odiar. Es preferible eso a no sentir nada. DORA: Sí, es preferible. (El la mira. Dan las siete.) STEPAN (volviéndose bruscamente): Va a pasar el gran duque. DORA (se dirige a la ventana y se pega a los cristales. Largo silencio. Y después, a lo lejos, el: carruaje. Se acerca, pasa.) : Si está solo... (El carruaje se aleja. Una terrible explosión. Sobresalto de DO-RA, que esconde la cabeza en las manos. Largo silencio.) STEPAN: ¡Boria no arrojó la bomba! Yanek ha triunfado. ¡Ha triunfado! ¡Oh pueblo! ¡Oh alegría! DORA (cayendo en lágrimas sobre él): ¡Nosotros lo hemos ma-tado! ¡Nosotros lo hemos matado! He sido yo. STEPAN (gritando): ¿A quién hemos matado? ¿A Yanek?  DORA: Al gran duque.    TELÓN         39  ACTO CUARTO  Una celda en la torre Pugatchev, en la prisión Butirki. Por la mañana.  Al levantarse el telón, KALIAYEV está en la celda y mira a la puerta. Un GUARDIÁN y un PRISIONERO, que trae un cubo, entran.  EL GUARDIÁN: Limpia. Y rápido. (Se sitúa junto a la ventana. FOKA comienza a limpiar sin mi-rar a KALIAYEV. Silencio.) KALIAYEV: ¿Cómo te llamas, hermano?  FOKA: Foka. KALIAYEV: ¿Estás condenado?  FOKA: Así parece. KALIAYEV: ¿Qué hiciste?  FOKA: Maté. KALIAYEV: ¿Tenías hambre?  EL GUARDIÁN: No tan alto.  KALIAYEV: ¿Cómo?  EL GUARDIÁN: No tan alto. Os dejo hablar a pesar de la con-signa. Así que no hables tan alto. Imita al viejo. KALIAYEV: ¿Tenías hambre?  FOKA: No, tenía sed.  KALIAYEV: ¿Y entonces? FOKA: Entonces, había un hacha. Lo deshice todo. Parece que  40 maté a tres. (KALIAYEV le mira.) Bueno, barín, ¿ya no me lla-mas hermano? ¿Te has enfriado?  KALIAYEV: No. Yo también maté. FOKA: ¿A cuántos? KALIAYEV: Te lo diré, hermano, si quieres. Pero contéstame; te arrepientes de lo que pasó, ¿verdad? FOKA: Claro, veinte años es caro. Te hacen arrepentirte. KALIAYEV: Veinte años. Entro aquí a los veintitrés y salgo con el pelo gris. FOKA: ¡Oh! Tal vez a ti te vaya mejor. Los jueces tienen altiba-jos. Depende de si están casados y con quién. Y además tú eres barín. No es la misma tarifa que para los pobres diablos. Sal-drás del paso. KALIAYEV: No lo creo. Y no quiero. No podría soportar la ver-güenza durante veinte años. FOKA: ¿La vergüenza? ¿Qué vergüenza? En fin, son ideas de barín. ¿A cuántos mataste?  KALIAYEV: A uno solo. FOKA: ¿Qué dices? Eso no es nada.  KALIAYEV: Maté al gran duque Sergio. FOKA: ¿Al gran duque? Eh, buena la hiciste. ¡Hay que ver a estos barines! Es grave, ¿verdad? KALIAYEV: Es grave. Pero era necesario. FOKA: ¿Por qué? ¿Vivías en la corte? Una historia de mujeres, ¿no? Guapo como eres...  KALIAYEV: Soy socialista. EL GUARDIÁN: No tan alto. KALIAYEV (más alto): Soy socialista revolucionario, FOKA: ¡Vaya! ¿Y qué necesidad tenías tú de ser lo que dices? No tenías más que quedarte tranquilo y todo te hubiera ido  41 bien. La tierra se ha hecho para los barines. KALIAYEV: No, se ha hecho para ti. Hay demasiada miseria y demasiados crímenes. Cuando haya menos miseria, habrá me-nos crímenes. Si la tierra fuera libre, tú no estarías aquí.  FOKA: Sí y no. En fin, libre o no, nunca es bueno beber un trago de más. KALIAYEV: Nunca es bueno. Sólo que se bebe porque se está humillado. Llegará un día en que ya no sea útil beber, en que nadie sienta vergüenza: ni el barín, ni el pobre diablo. Todos seremos hermanos y la justicia hará transparentes nuestros co-razones. ¿Sabes de qué te hablo? FOKA: Sí, del reino de Dios.  EL GUARDIÁN: No tan alto. KALIAYEV: No hay que decir eso, hermano. Dios no puede nada. ¡La justicia es cosa nuestra! (Un silencio.) ¿No compren-des? ¿Conoces la leyenda de San Demetrio? FOKA: No. KALIAYEV: Tenía cita en la estepa con el mismo Dios, y allá iba de prisa cuando encontró a un campesino con el carro atasca-do. Entonces San Demetrio lo ayudó. El barro era espeso, el bache profundo. Hubo que luchar durante una hora. Y al ter-minar, San Demetrio corrió a la cita, pero Dios ya no estaba. FOKA: ¿Y entonces? KALIAYEV: Y entonces están los que siempre llegarán tarde a la cita porque hay demasiadas carretas atascadas y demasiados hermanos que socorrer. (FOKA retrocede.) KALIAYEV: ¿Qué te pasa? EL GUARDIÁN: No tan alto. Y tú, viejo, date prisa. FOKA: No me fío. Todo esto no es normal. A nadie se le ocurre hacerse meter en la cárcel por historias de santos y de carretas. Y, además, hay otra cosa...  42 (EL GUARDIÁN se ríe.) KALIAYEV (MirándOlo): ¿Qué? FOKA: ¿Qué les hacen a los que matan a los grandes duques? KALIAYEV: Los cuelgan. FOKA: ¡Ah! (Y se va, mientras EL GUARDIÁN ríe cada vez más fuerte.) KALIAYEV: Quédate. ¿Qué te he hecho yo? FOKA: No me has hecho nada. Por muy barín que seas, no quiero engañarte. Uno charla, así pasa el tiempo, pero si te van a colgar, no está bien.  KALIAYEV: ¿Por qué? EL GUARDIÁN (riendo): Vamos, viejo, díselo... FOKA: Porque no puedes hablarme como a un hermano. Yo soy el que cuelga a los condenados. KALIAYEV: ¿No eres tú también un forzado? FOKA: Precisamente por eso. Me propusieron hacer este traba-jo, y por cada ahorcado me quitan un año de cárcel. Es un buen negocio. KALIAYEV: ¿Para perdonarte tus crímenes, te hacen cometer otros? FOKA: Oh, no son crímenes, porque hay una orden. Y, ade-más, eso les da igual. Si quieres saber mi opinión, no son cris-tianos. KALIAYEV: ¿Y cuántas veces, ya?  FOKA: Dos veces.  (KALIAYEV retrocede. Los otros se dirigen a la puerta; EL GUAR-DIÁN empuja a FOKA.) KALIAYEV: ¿Así que eres un verdugo?  FOKA (en la puerta): Bueno, barín, ¿y tú?  43 (Sale. Se oyen pasos, órdenes. Entra SKURATOV, muy elegante, con EL GUARDIÁN.) SKURATOV: Déjanos. Buenos días. ¿No me conoce? Yo sí le conozco. (Se ríe.) Ya célebre, ¿eh? (Le mira.) ¿Puedo presentar-me? (KALIAYEV no dice nada) ¿No dice nada? Comprendo. La incomunicación, ¿eh? Debe de ser muy duro estar ocho días incomunicado. Hoy hemos suprimido la incomunicación y ten-drá usted visitas. Estoy aquí para eso, además. Ya le mandé a Foka. Excepcional, ¿verdad? Pensé que le interesaría. ¿Está con-tento? Es bueno ver caras después de ocho días. ¿No? KALIAYEV: Todo depende de la cara. SKURATOV: Buena voz, bien timbrada. Usted sabe lo que quie-re (Una pausa.) Si he comprendido bien, mi cara no 1e gusta, ¿verdad? KALIAYEV: Sí. SKURATOV: ¡Qué decepción! Pero es un malentendido. Lo que pasa es que esto está muy mal iluminado. En un sótano nadie es simpático. Además, usted no me conoce. A veces una cara echa hacia atrás. Pero luego, cuando se conoce a fondo al... KALIAYEV: Basta. ¿Quién es usted? SKURATOV: Skuratov, director del departamento de Policía.  KALIAYEV: Un lacayo. SKURATOV: Para servir a usted. Pero en su lugar yo me mostra-ría menos orgulloso. Tal vez llegue a sucederle lo mismo. Se comienza por querer la justicia y se acaba organizando una policía. Por lo demás, la verdad no me asusta. Voy a ser franco con usted. Usted me interesa y le ofrezco los medios de obte-ner la gracia. KALIAYEV: ¿Qué gracia? SKURATOV: ¿Cómo, qué gracia? Le ofrezco salvarle la vida. KALIAYEV: ¿Quién se lo ha pedido? SKURATOV: La vida no se pide, querido amigo. Se recibe.  44 ¿Nunca concedió usted gracia a nadie? (Pausa.) Piénselo bien. KALIAYEV: Rechazo su gracia de una vez por todas. SKURATOV: Escúcheme, al menos. No soy su enemigo, a pesar de las apariencias. Admito que pueda usted tener razón en lo que piensa. Salvo en lo que se refiere al asesinato... KALIAYEV: Le prohíbo emplear esa palabra. SKURATOV (mirándolo): ¡Ah! Nervios delicados, ¿eh? (Pausa.) Sinceramente, quisiera ayudarle. KALIAYEV: ¿Ayudarme? Estoy dispuesto a pagar lo necesario. Pero no le soportaré esa familiaridad conmigo. Déjeme. SKURATOV: La acusación que pesa sobre usted...  KALIAYEV: Rectifico. SKURATOV: ¿Cómo dice? KALIAYEV: Rectifico. Soy un prisionero de guerra, no un acu-sado. SKURATOV: Como usted quiera. Sin embargo, causó usted es-tragos, ¿verdad? Dejemos de lado al gran duque y a la política. Por lo menos, hubo muerte de hombre. ¡Y qué muerte! KALIAYEV: Arrojé la bomba contra la tiranía de ustedes, no contra un hombre.  SKURATOV: Sin duda. Pero fue el hombre quien la recibió. Y eso no le sentó nada bien. ¿Sabe usted, querido amigo, que cuando encontraron el cuerpo faltaba la cabeza? ¡La cabeza, desaparecida! En cuanto al resto, apenas si pudo reconocerse un brazo y una parte de la pierna. KALIAYEV: Yo ejecuté una sentencia. SKURATOV: Tal vez, tal vez. Nadie le reprocha la sentencia. ¿Qué es una sentencia? Es una palabra que puede discutirse noches enteras. Lo que se le reprocha... no, a usted no le gusta-ría esa palabra.... es, digamos, un trabajo de aficionado, un po-co desordenado, cuyas consecuencias, eso sí, son indiscutibles. Todo el mundo ha podido verlas. Pregúnteselo a la gran du- 45 quesa. Había sangre, ¿comprende?, mucha sangre. KALIAYEV: Cállese. SKURATOV: Bien. Yo quería decir simplemente que si usted se obstina en hablar de la sentencia, en mantener que fue el parti-do y sólo él quien juzgó y ejecutó, que el gran duque fue muerto no por una bomba, sino por una idea, entonces usted no necesita la gracia. Suponga, sin embargo, que volvamos a la evidencia, suponga que fue usted el que hizo saltar la cabeza del gran duque; entonces, todo cambia, ¿verdad? En ese caso usted necesitará la gracia. Quiero ayudarle. Por pura simpatía, créame. (Sonríe.) Qué quiere usted, a mí no me interesan las ideas, me interesan las personas. KALIAYEV (estallando): Mi persona está por encima de usted y de sus amos. Usted puede matarme, no juzgarme. Sé a dónde quiere llegar. Busca un punto débil y espera de mí una actitud avergonzada, lágrimas y arrepentimiento. No conseguirá nada. Lo que yo soy no le concierne. Lo que le concierne es nuestro odio, el mío y el de mis hermanos. Está a su servicio. SKURATOV: ¿El odio? Otra idea. Lo que no es una idea es el crimen. Y sus consecuencias, naturalmente. Quiero decir, el arrepentimiento y el castigo. Ahí estamos en la realidad. Por eso me hice policía. Para estar en el centro de las cosas. Pero a usted no le gustan las confidencias. (Una pausa, se acerca len-tamente a él.) Todo lo que quería decirle es esto: no debería usted fingir que ha olvidado la cabeza del gran duque. Si la tuviera en cuenta, la idea ya no le serviría de nada. Se sentiría avergonzado, por ejemplo, en lugar de enorgullecerse de lo que ha hecho. Y a partir del momento en que sienta vergüenza, deseará usted vivir para reparar. Lo más importante es que us-ted se decida a vivir. KALIAYEV: ¿Y si me decidiera? SKURATOV: Obtendría la gracia para usted y para sus camara-das.  KALIAYEV: ¿Los ha detenido? SKURATOV: No. Precisamente. Pero si se decide usted a vivir,  46 los detendremos. KALIAYEV: ¿He comprendido bien? SKURATOV: Con seguridad. No se enoje otra vez. Reflexione. Desde el punto de vista de la causa usted no puede entregarlos. Desde el punto de vista de la evidencia, por el contrario, les hace un favor. Les evitará nuevos problemas y, al mismo tiem-po, los liberará de la horca. Pero, sobre todo, obtendrá usted la paz del corazón. Desde muchos puntos de vista, es un negocio ventajoso. (KALIAYEV calla.) ¿Entonces? KALIAYEV: Mis hermanos no tardarán en darle la respuesta. SKURATOV: ¡Otro crimen! Decididamente, es una vocación. Bueno, mi misión ha terminado. Mi corazón está triste. Pero veo que usted se aferra a sus ideas. No puedo separarlo de ellas. KALIAYEV: Usted no puede separarme de mis hermanos. SKURATOV: Hasta la vista. (Hace como que sale, y volviéndose.) ¿Por qué, en este caso, perdonó usted la vida a la gran duquesa y a sus sobrinos? KALIAYEV: ¿Quién se lo dijo? SKURATOV: El informador de ustedes nos informaba a nosotros también. En parte, al menos... Pero ¿por qué les perdonó la vida? KALIAYEV: Eso no le interesa. SKURATOV(riendo): ¿Le parece? Voy a decirle por qué. Una idea puede matar a un gran duque, pero difícilmente llega a matar niños. Eso es lo que usted descubrió. Entonces se plantea una cuestión: si la idea no llega a matar niños, ¿merece que se mate a un gran duque? (KALIAYEV hace un gesto.) ¡Oh, no me conteste, no me conteste! Se lo dirá usted a la gran duquesa. KALIAYEV: ¿A la gran duquesa? SKURATOV: Sí, quiere verlo. Y yo vine sobre todo para asegu-rarme de que esta conversación era posible. Lo es. Hasta puede hacerle cambiar de opinión. La gran duquesa es cristiana. El  47 alma, ¿sabe?, es su especialidad. (Se ríe.) KALIAYEV: No quiero verla. SKURATOV: Lo siento, ella insiste. Y después de todo, usted le debe algunas consideraciones. Además dicen que desde la muerte de su marido no está en sus cabales. No hemos querido contrariarla. (En la puerta.) Si cambia de opinión, no olvide mi propuesta. Volveré. (Una pausa. Escucha.) Aquí está. ¡Después de la policía, la religión! Decididamente, le mimamos. Pero to-do se relaciona. Imagínese a Dios sin las prisiones. ¡Qué sole-dad! (Sale. Se oyen voces y órdenes.)  (Entra LA GRAN DUQUESA, que permanece inmóvil y silenciosa. La puerta está abierta.) KALIAYEV: ¿Qué quiere? LA GRAN DUQUESA (descubriéndose la cara ): Mira. (KALIA-YEV calla.) Muchas cosas mueren con un hombre. KALIAYEV: Lo sabía. LA GRAN DUQUESA (con naturalidad, pero con una vocecita gastada): Los asesinos no lo saben. Si lo supieran, ¿cómo po-drían matar? (Silencio.) KALIAYEV: Ya la he visto. Ahora deseo estar solo. LA GRAN DUQUESA: No. Necesito mirarte también. (KALIAYEV retrocede. LA GRAN DUQUESA se sienta, como agotada.)Ya no puedo estar sola. Antes, si yo sufría, él podía ver mi sufrimien-to. Sufrir era algo bueno entonces. Ahora... No, ya no podía estar sola, callarme... Pero ¿con quién hablar? Los otros no sa-ben. Fingen estar tristes. Lo están, una hora o dos. Después se van a comer, y a dormir... A dormir, sobre todo... Pensé que debías de parecerte a mí. Tú no duermes, estoy segura. ¿Y con quién hablar del crimen, sino con el criminal? KALIAYEV: ¿Qué crimen? Sólo recuerdo un acto de justicia. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¡La misma voz! La misma voz que él. To-dos los hombres adoptan el mismo tono para hablar de la justi- 48 cia. El decía: «¡Eso es justo!», y uno debía callar. Tal vez se equi-vocaba, tal vez tú te equivocas... KALIAYEV: El encarnaba la suprema injusticia, la que hace ge-mir al pueblo ruso desde hace siglos. Por ello, sólo recibía pri-vilegios. Aunque yo me equivocara, la prisión y la muerte son mi pago. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Sí, tú sufres. Pero a él lo mataste.  KALIAYEV: Murió sorprendido. Una muerte así no es nada. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Nada? (Más bajo.) Es cierto. Te trajeron enseguida. Parece que pronunciabas discursos en medio de los policías. Comprendo. Eso te ayudaría. Pero yo llegué unos se-gundos después. Vi. Puse en una camilla todo lo que pude en-contrar. ¡Cuánta sangre! (Una pausa.) Yo llevaba un vestido blanco...  KALIAYEV: Cállese. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Por qué? Digo la verdad. ¿Sabes qué ha-cía él dos horas antes de morir? Dormía. En un sillón, con los pies sobre una silla... como siempre. Dormía, y tú lo esperabas, en la noche cruel... (Llora.) Ayúdame ahora. (Él retrocede, rígi-do.) Eres joven. No puedes ser malo. KALIAYEV: No he tenido tiempo de ser joven. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Por qué te pones tan rígido? ¿Nunca tu-viste compasión de ti mismo? KALIAYEV No. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Haces mal. Eso alivia. Yo ya no tengo compasión sino de mí misma. (Una pausa.) Sufro. Debiste ma-tarme con él, en vez de perdonarme la vida. KALIAYEV: No se la perdoné a usted, sino a los niños que iban con usted. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Lo sé... Yo no los quería mucho. (Una pausa.) Son los sobrinos del gran duque. ¿No eran culpables como su tío?  49 KALIAYEV: No. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Los conoces? Mi sobrina tiene mal cora-zón. Se niega a dar ella misma limosna a los pobres. Tiene miedo de tocarlos. ¿No es ella injusta? Es injusta. El, por lo me-nos, quería a los campesinos. Bebía con ellos. Y tú lo mataste. Ciertamente, tú también eres injusto. La tierra está desierta. KALIAYEV: Todo esto es inútil. Usted intenta dejarme sin fuer-zas y desesperarme. No lo conseguirá. Déjeme. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿No quieres rezar conmigo, arrepentirte?... Así no estaremos solos.  KALIAYEV: Déjeme prepararme a morir. Si no muriera, enton-ces sí sería un asesino. LA GRAN DUQUESA (se yergue): ¿Morir? ¿Quieres morir? No. (Se acerca a KALIAYEV con gran agitación.) Debes vivir y conven-certe de que eres un asesino. ¿No lo mataste? Dios te justificará. KALIAYEV: ¿Qué Dios, el mío o el suyo? LA GRAN DUQUESA: El de la Santa Iglesia. KALIAYEV: La Santa Iglesia no tiene nada que ver con esto. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Ella sirve a un señor que también cono-ció la prisión.  KALIAYEV: Los tiempos han cambiado. Y la Santa Iglesia ha escogido entre la herencia de su señor. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Qué ha escogido? ¿Qué quieres decir? KALIAYEV: Se ha quedado con la gracia y dejó en nuestras manos el ejercicio de la caridad. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿A nosotros? ¿A quiénes?  KALIAYEV (gritando): A todos los que ustedes ahorcan. (Silen-cio.) LA GRAN DUQUESA (con dulzura): Yo no soy enemiga vuestra. KALIAYEV (con desesperación): Lo es, como todos los de su raza y de su clan. Hay algo todavía más abyecto que ser un  50 criminal: forzar al crimen a quien no ha nacido para él. Míreme. Le juro que yo no estaba hecho para matar. LA GRAN DUQUESA: No me hable como si fuera su enemiga. Mire. (Cierra la puerta.) Confío en usted. (Llora.) La sangre nos separa. Pero usted puede alcanzarme en Dios, en el lugar mis-mo de la desdicha. Por lo menos, rece conmigo. KALIAYEV: Me niego. (Se acerca a ella.) Sólo siento por usted compasión y acaba de conmover mi alma. Ahora me compren-derá, porque no le ocultaré nada. Ya no espero la cita con Dios. Pero al morir seré puntual en la cita que tengo con los que amo, con mis hermanos que piensan en mí en este mo-mento. Rezar sería traicionarlos. LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Qué quiere usted decir? KALIAYEV (con exaltación): Nada, sino que voy a ser feliz. Tengo que sostener una larga lucha y la sostendré. Pero cuando se pronuncie el veredicto y la ejecución esté lista, al pie del cadalso me apartaré de usted y de este mundo horrible y me dejaré llevar al amor que colma. ¿Me comprende? LA GRAN DUQUESA: No hay amor lejos de Dios.  KALIAYEV: Sí. El amor por la criatura. LA GRAN DUQUESA: La criatura es abyecta. ¿Qué otra cosa cabe hacer sino destruirla o perdonarla? KALIAYEV: Morir con ella. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Morimos solos. El murió solo. KALIAYEV (con desesperación): ¡Morir con ella! Los que hoy se aman, deben morir juntos si quieren reunirse. La injusticia sepa-ra, la vergüenza, el dolor, el daño que se hace a los demás, el crimen separan. Vivir es una tortura, puesto que vivir separa... LA GRAN DUQUESA: Dios junta. KALIAYEV: No en este mundo. Y mis citas son en este mundo. LA GRAN DUQUESA: Es la cita de los perros, con el hocico en el suelo, siempre husmeando, siempre decepcionados.  51 KALIAYEV (vuelto hacia la ventana): Pronto lo sabré. (Una pausa.) Pero ¿no es posible imaginar que dos seres que renun-cian a toda alegría, se amen en el dolor sin poder darse otra cita que la del dolor? (La mira.) ¿No es posible imaginar que la misma cuerda una entonces a esos dos seres? LA GRAN DUQUESA: ¿Qué es ese amor terrible?  KALIAYEV: Usted y los suyos nunca nos han permitido otro.  LA GRAN DUQUESA: Yo también amaba al que usted mató. KALIAYEV: Lo he comprendido. Por eso le perdono el mal que usted y los suyos me han hecho. (Una pausa.) Ahora, déjeme. (Largo silencio.) LA GRAN DUQUESA (irguiéndose): Voy a dejarle. Pero vine aquí para conducirle a Dios, ahora lo sé. Usted quiere juzgarse y salvarse solo. No puede hacerlo. Dios podrá, si usted vive. Pediré gracia para usted. KALIAYEV: Se lo suplico, no lo haga. Déjeme morir o la odiaré mortalmente. LA GRAN DUQUESA (en la puerta): Pediré gracia para usted, a los hombres y a Dios.  KALIAYEV: No, no, se lo prohíbo. (Corre a la puerta para en-contrar de repente a SKURATOV. KALIAYEV retrocede, cierra los ojos. Silencio. Mira a SKURATOV de nuevo.)  Le necesitaba. SKURATOV: Aquí me tiene, encantado. ¿Por qué?  KALIAYEV: Necesitaba despreciar de nuevo.  SKURATOV: Lástima. Venía a buscar la respuesta para mí.  KALIAYEV: Ya la tiene. SKURATOV (cambiando de tono): No, todavía no la tengo. Escuche bien. He facilitado esta entrevista con la gran duquesa para poder publicar mañana la noticia en los periódicos. El relato será exacto, salvo en un punto. Consignará la confesión de su arrepentimiento. Sus camaradas pensarán que usted los ha traicionado.  52 KALIAYEV (tranquilamente): No lo creerán. SKURATOV: Sólo detendré la publicación en caso de que usted confiese. Tiene la noche para decidirse. (Vuelve hacia la puer-ta.)  KALIAYEV (más fuerte): No le creerán. SKURATOV (volviéndose): ¿Por qué? ¿Nunca han pecado?  KALIAYEV: Usted no conoce el amor de ellos. SKURATOV: No. Pero sé que no se puede creer en la fraterni-dad toda una noche, sin un solo minuto de desfallecimiento. Esperaré el desfallecimiento. (Cierra la puerta a sus espaldas.) No se apresure. Soy paciente. (Permanecen frente a frente.)   TELÓN               53  ACTO QUINTO  Otro piso, pero en el mismo estilo. Una semana después. De no-che. Silencio. DORA se pasea de un extremo a otro.    ANNENKOV: Descansa, Dora.  DORA: Tengo frío. ANNENKOV: Ven a echarte aquí. Tápate. DORA (siempre caminando): La noche es larga. ¡Qué frío ten-go, Boria! (Llaman. Un golpe, luego dos. ANNENKOV va a abrir. Entran STEPAN y VOINOV que se acerca a DORA y la besa. Ella le estre-cha en sus brazos.) DORA: ¡Alexis! STEPAN: Orlov dice que podría ser esta noche. Todos los sub-oficiales que no están de servicio han sido convocados. De modo que estará presente. ANNENKOV: ¿Dónde te encontrarás con él? STEPAN: Nos esperará a VOINOV y a mí en el restaurante de la calle Sophískaia.  DORA (que se ha sentado, agotada): Será esta noche, Boria. ANNENKOV: Aún no está perdido todo, la decisión depende del zar.  STEPAN: La decisión dependerá del zar si Yanek ha pedido gracia.  DORA: No la ha pedido,  54 STEPAN: ¿Por qué iba a ver a la gran duquesa sino para pedir gracia? Ella hizo decir por todas partes que Yanek se había arrepentido. ¿Cómo saber la verdad? DORA: Sabemos lo que dijo delante del Tribunal y lo que nos ha escrito. Yanek dijo que lamentaba no disponer sino de una sola vida para arrojarla como un desafío a la autocracia. El hombre que dijo eso, ¿puede mendigar gracia, puede arrepen-tirse? No; quería, quiere morir. No se reniega de un acto como el suyo.  STEPAN: No debió ver a la gran duquesa. DORA: Él es su único juez. STEPAN: Según nuestra regla, no debía verla. DORA: Nuestra regla es matar, nada más. Ahora es libre, libre por fin.  STEPAN: Todavía no. DORA: Es libre. Tiene derecho a hacer lo que quiera, ahora que va a morir. ¡Porque morirá, alegraos! ANNENKOV: ¡Dora! DORA: Sí. ¡Si obtuviera gracia, qué triunfo! Sería la prueba, ¿no es cierto?, de que la gran duquesa dijo la verdad, de que él se arrepintió y traicionó. Si muere, por el contrario, le creeréis y podréis seguir queriéndole. (Les mira.) Vuestro amor sale caro. VOINOV (acercándose a ella): No, Dora. Nunca hemos dudado de él. DORA (caminando de un extremo a otro de la habitación): Sí... Tal vez... Perdonadme. ¡Pero qué importa, después de todo! Vamos a saberlo esta noche... Ah, pobre Alexis, ¿qué has veni-do a hacer aquí? VOINOV: A reemplazarlo. Lloré, estaba orgulloso al leer su dis-curso en el proceso. Cuando leí. «La muerte será mi suprema protesta contra un mundo de lágrimas y de sangre»... me eché a temblar.  55 DORA: Un mundo de lágrimas y de sangre... Dijo eso, es cierto. VOINOV: Lo dijo. .. ¡Ah, DORA, qué valor! Y al final su gran grito: «Si he estado a la altura de la protesta humana contra la violencia, que la muerte corone mi obra con la pureza de la idea.» Entonces decidí venir. DORA (escondiendo el rostro en sus manos): Él quería la pure-za, sí. ¡Pero qué atroz coronación! VOINOV: No llores, DORA. Ha pedido que nadie llore su muer-te. Oh, le comprendo tan bien ahora. No puedo dudar de él. He sufrido por haber sido cobarde. Y después arrojé la bomba en Tiflis. Ahora no me diferencio de Yanek. Cuando me enteré de su condena, sólo tuve una idea: ocupar su sitio, ya que no había podido estar a su lado. DORA: ¿Quién puede ocupar su sitio esta noche? Estará solo, Alexis. VOINOV: Debemos sostenerlo con nuestro orgullo, como él nos sostiene con su ejemplo. No llores.  DORA: Mira. Tengo los ojos secos. ¡Pero orgullosa, no, nunca más podré estar orgullosa! STEPAN: DORA, no me juzgues mal. Deseo que Yanek viva. Necesitamos hombres como él. DORA: Él no lo desea. Y debemos desear que muera.  ANNENKOV: Estás loca. DORA: Debemos desearlo. Conozco su corazón. Así se sentirá apaciguado. ¡Oh, sí, que muera! (Más bajo.) Pero que muera rápido. STEPAN: Me voy, Boria. Ven, Alexis. Orlov nos espera.  ANNENKOV: Sí, y no tardéis en volver. (STEPAN Y VOINOV se dirigen a la puerta. STEPAN mira a DO-RA.) STEPAN: Vamos a enterarnos. Cuídala.  56 (DORA está junto a la ventana. ANNENKOV la mira.) DORA: ¡La muerte! ¡La horca! ¡La muerte una vez más! ¡Ay, Bo-ria!  ANNENKOV: Sí, hermanita. Pero no hay otra solución. DORA: No digas eso. Si la única solución es la muerte, no va-mos por buen camino. El buen camino es el que conduce a la vida, al sol. No se puede tener siempre frío. ANNENKOV: Eso también conduce a la vida. A la vida de los demás. Rusia vivirá, nuestros nietos vivirán. Recuerda lo que decía Yanek: «Rusia será hermosa.» DORA: Los demás, nuestros nietos... Sí. Pero Yanek está, en la cárcel y la cuerda es fría. Quizá ha muerto ya para que los otros vivan. ¡Ay, Boria!, ¿y si los otros no vivieran? ¿Y si muriera por nada? ANNENKOV: Calla. (Silencio.) DORA: Qué frío hace. Y eso que estamos en primavera. Hay árboles en el patio de la cárcel, lo sé. Él ha de verlos. ANNENKOV: Espera a saber. No tiembles así. DORA: Siento tanto frío que tengo la impresión de estar ya muerta. (Una pausa.) Todo esto nos envejece tan rápidamente. Nunca ya seremos niños, Boria. Con el primer crimen, huye la infancia. Arrojo la bomba y en un segundo, ¿sabes?, transcurre toda una vida. Ay, en adelante podemos morir. Hemos dado ya la vuelta al hombre.  ANNENKOV: Entonces moriremos luchando, como lo hacen los hombres.  DORA: Habéis ido demasiado rápido. Ya no sois hombres. ANNENKOV: La desdicha y la miseria también iban rápidas. Ya no hay lugar para la paciencia y la maduración en este mundo. Rusia tiene prisa. DORA: Lo sé. Nos hemos hecho cargo de la desdicha del mun-do. El también se había hecho cargo. ¡Qué valor! Pero a veces  57 me digo que es un orgullo que será castigado. ANNENKOV: Es un orgullo que pagamos con nuestra vida. Na-die puede ir más lejos. Es un orgullo al que tenemos derecho. DORA: ¿Estamos seguros de que nadie irá más lejos? A veces, cuando escucho a Stepan, siento miedo. Quizá lleguen otros que fundarán su autoridad en nosotros para matar y que no pagarán con sus vidas. ANNENKOV: Eso sería una cobardía, Dora. DORA: ¿Quién sabe? Tal vez eso sea la justicia. Y entonces na-die se atreverá ya a mirarla de frente. ANNENKOV: ¡Dora! (Ella calla.) ¿Estás dudando? No te reco-nozco. DORA: Tengo frío. Pienso en él que no ha de permitirse tem-blar para que no crean que tiene miedo. ANNENKOV: ¿Entonces no estás ya con nosotros? DORA (se lanza hacia él): ¡Oh, Boria, estoy con vosotros! Lle-garé hasta el fin. Odio la tiranía y sé que no podemos hacer otra cosa. Pero yo elegí esto con el corazón gozoso y ahora continúo con el corazón triste. Esa es la diferencia. Somos pri-sioneros. ANNENKOV: Rusia entera está en prisión. Haremos volar sus muros en pedazos.  DORA: Dame la bomba y ya verás. Avanzaré en medio de la hoguera y sin embargo mi paso será firme. Es fácil, es mucho más fácil morir de sus contradicciones que vivirlas. ¿Has amado, por lo menos, has amado, Boria? ANNENKOV: He amado, pero hace tanto tiempo que ya no me acuerdo.  DORA: ¿Cuánto tiempo? ANNENKOV: Cuatro años. DORA: ¿Cuántos hace que diriges la organización?  58 ANNENKOV: Cuatro. (Una pausa.) Ahora mi amor es para la organización. DORA (caminando hacia la ventana): ¡Amar, sí, pero ser amada! ... No, hay que seguir en marcha. Uno quisiera detenerse. ¡En marcha! ¡En marcha! Uno quisiera tender los brazos y dejarse llevar. Pero la cochina injusticia se nos pega como el engrudo. ¡En marcha! Estamos condenados a ser más grandes que noso-tros mismos. Los seres, los rostros, eso es lo que uno quisiera amar. ¡El amor más bien que la justicia! No, hay que seguir en marcha. ¡En marcha, DORA! ¡En marcha, Yanek! (Llora.) Pero para él, se acerca el fin. ANNENKOV (tomándola en sus brazos): Será agraciado. DORA (mirándolo): Bien sabes que no. Bien sabes que no es-taría bien. (Él aparta la mirada.) Tal vez está saliendo ya al patio. Toda esa gente de pronto silenciosa, apenas él aparece. Con tal de que no tenga frío. Boria, ¿sabes cómo ahorcan? ANNENKOV: En el extremo de una cuerda. ¡Basta, Dora! DORA (ciegamente): El verdugo salta sobre los hombros. El cuello está saliendo. ¿No es terrible? ANNENKOV: Sí. En cierto sentido. En otro sentido, es la felici-dad.  DORA: ¿La felicidad? ANNENKOV: Sentir la mano de un hombre antes de morir. (DORA se arroja a un sillón. Silencio.) Dora, habrá que mar-charse en seguida. Descansaremos un poco. DORA (enajenada): ¿Marcharse? ¿Con quién?  ANNENKOV: Conmigo, Dora. DORA (le mira): ¡Marcharse! (Mira hacia la ventana.) Llega el alba. Yanek ha muerto ya, estoy segura. ANNENKOV: Soy tu hermano. DORA: Sí, eres mi hermano. Todos sois mis hermanos y os quiero. (Se oye la lluvia. Amanece. DORA habla en voz baja.)  59 ¡Pero qué horrible gusto tiene a veces la fraternidad! (Llaman. Entran VOINOV y STEPAN. Todos permanecen inmó-viles, DORA vacila pero se recobra con un visible esfuerzo.) STEPAN (en voz baja ): Yanek no ha traicionado.  ANNENKOV: ¿Orlov pudo verlo? STEPAN: Sí. DORA (avanzando firmemente): Siéntate. Cuenta.  STEPAN: ¿Para qué? DORA: Cuéntalo todo. Tengo el derecho de saber. Exijo que lo cuentes. Con detalles.  STEPAN: No sabré hacerlo. Y además ahora hay que marcharse.  DORA: No, hablarás. ¿Cuándo le avisaron? STEPAN: A las diez de la noche.  DORA: ¿Cuándo lo ahorcaron?  STEPAN: A las dos de la mañana.  DORA: ¿Y durante cuatro horas esperó? STEPAN: Sí, sin decir ni una palabra. Y después, todo se preci-pitó. Ahora se acabó. DORA: ¿Cuatro horas sin hablar? Espera un poco. ¿Cómo iba vestido? ¿Tenía puesto el capote? STEPAN: No. Estaba todo de negro, sin abrigo. Y llevaba un sombrero negro.  DORA: ¿Qué tiempo hacía? STEPAN: Noche cerrada. La nieve estaba sucia. Y después, la lluvia la convirtió en un barro pegajoso. DORA: ¿Temblaba?  STEPAN: No. DORA: ¿Miró a Orlov?   60 STEPAN: No. DORA: ¿Qué miraba? STEPAN: A todo el mundo, dice Orlov, sin ver nada.  DORA: ¿Qué más, qué más? STEPAN: Deja, Dora. DORA: No, quiero saber. Su muerte, por lo menos, es mía. STEPAN: Le leyeron la sentencia. DORA: ¿Qué hacía entre tanto? STEPAN: Nada. Una vez solamente sacudió la pierna para quí-tarse un poco de barro que le manchaba el zapato. DORA (con la cabeza en las manos): ¡Un poco de barro! ANNENKOV(bruscamente): ¿Cómo lo sabes? (STEPAN calla.) ¿Le preguntaste todo eso a Orlov? ¿Por qué? STEPAN (apartando la mirada): Había algo entre Yanek y yo. ANNENKOV: ¿Qué? STEPAN: Yo le envidiaba. DORA: ¿Qué más, Stepan, qué más? STEPAN: El padre Florenski fue a presentarle el crucifijo. El se negó a besarlo. Y declaró: «Ya le dije que he terminado con la vida y estoy en regla con la muerte.»  DORA: ¿Cómo estaba su voz? STEPAN: Exactamente igual. Sin la febrilidad Y la impaciencia que le conocíais.  DORA: ¿Parecía feliz? ANNENKOV: ¿Estás loca? DORA: Sí, sí, estoy segura. Parecía feliz. Porque sería demasia-do injusto que habiéndose negado a ser feliz en la vida para prepararse mejor al sacrificio, no hubiera recibido la felicidad al mismo tiempo que la muerte. Era feliz y marchó con calma a la  61 horca, ¿no es cierto? STEPAN: Alguien cantaba en el río con un acordeón. Caminó. Unos perros ladraron en ese momento. DORA: Entonces subió... STEPAN: Subió. Se hundió en la noche. Se veía vagamente el sudario con que lo cubrió de arriba abajo el verdugo. DORA: Y después, y después...  STEPAN: Ruidos sordos. DORA: Ruidos sordos. ¡Yanek! Y luego... (STEPAN calla.) DORA (con violencia): Y luego, te digo. (STEPAN guarda Silen-cio.) Habla, Alexis. ¿ Luego? VOINOV: Un ruido horrible. DORA: ¡Ah! (Se lanza contra la pared.) (STEPAN desvía la cabeza. ANNENKOV, sin un gesto, llora. DO-RA se vuelve, les mira pegada a la pared.)  DORA (con voz cambiada, enajenada): No lloréis. ¡No, no, no lloréis! Ya veis que es el día de la justificación. Algo se eleva en esta hora que es nuestro testimonio de rebeldes: Yanek ya no es un asesino. ¡Un ruido terrible! Bastó un ruido terrible para retornar a la alegría de la infancia. ¿Recordáis su risa? Reía sin motivo a veces. ¡Qué joven era! ¡Ahora debe de estar riendo, con la cara pegada a la tierra! (Se dirige hacia ANNENKOV.) Boria, ¿eres mi hermano? ¿Dijiste que me ayudarías?  ANNENKOV: Sí. DORA: Entonces haz eso por mí. Dame la bomba. (ANNENKOV la mira.) Sí, la próxima vez. Quiero arrojarla yo. Quiero ser la primera en arrojarla. ANNENKOV: Sabes que no queremos mujeres en primera línea. DORA (con un grito): ¿Soy yo una mujer, ahora?  62 (La miran. Silencio.) VOINOV (despacito): Acepta, Boria.  STEPAN: Sí, acepta. ANNENKOV: Era tu turno, Stepan. DORA: Me la darás, ¿verdad? La arrojaré. Y más tarde, en una noche fría...  ANNENKOV: Sí, Dora. DORA (llorando) ¡Yanek! ¡Una noche fría, y la misma cuerda! Todo será más fácil ahora.     TELÓN    Biblioteca Virtual  OMEGALFA    '"
